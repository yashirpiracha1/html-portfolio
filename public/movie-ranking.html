<h2>The Best Movies According to Yashir</h2>
<h3>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h3>
<hr />
<h4>300</h4>
<p>This is my favourite motivational movie. I love the strong character, iron mindset and a high sense of responsibility of King Leonidas.</p>
<h4>Interstellar</h4>
<p>Really cool movie about space. What I love the most is how relativity of time space is demonstrated in the movie.</p>
<h4>Wolf of Wall Street</h4>
<p>Super exciting movie. I like to think I can be as good a motivational speaker, salesman and wealthy as Jordan Belfort at his peak.</p>
